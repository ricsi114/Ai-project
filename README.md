Creating a high rated beer recipe using AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI for short) is increasingly becoming an integral part
of peopleâ€™s daily lives. This is the same in the lives of different companies and industries.
As the use of artificial intelligence grows, we are seeing more and more surprising uses for
AI, from education and manufacturing, to healthcare and energy suppliers, or even for
various social media platforms. According to this, it is not surprising that many opportunities
offered by Artificial Intelligence are being exploited by more and more disciplines. The
topic of my dissertation, beer production, is no exception. With this dissertation I have the
opportunity to present a less common use of Artificial Intelligence in the field of brewing,
that is still in early stage.
During the preparation of my dissertation, I sought to create a presumably high rated beer
recipe using Artificial Intelligence.
I would like to present the process of obtaining the data necessary for the task, the
documentation for the preparation of the program(s) needed to solve the problem, and the
general operation of an Artificial Intelligence system used in the task and its processes.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?
This use of AI is based on the thesis I wrote for my studies in university

The basic idea behind it comes from Brewdog. A Scottish multinational brewery and pub that published their beer recipies only in a pdf file called DIY Dog ( Source: https://www.brewdog.com/uk/diy-dog )
This idea has also been tested by Koen Van den Heuvel with a different approach than mine. ( Source: https://medium.com/@koenvandenheuvel/how-to-brew-a-beer-with-artificial-intelligence-6c742f5fd843 )

## How is it used?

Under construction.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
